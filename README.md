This project was completed to compare determine average costs from groups such as different regions, genders, ages, smoker identities, number of children, and bmis from the given data. These computed averages were then compared to the overall average from the data set to determine whether that group pays more or less than the average. This analysis could be used to determine what a person would need to do to lower their insurance cost.
